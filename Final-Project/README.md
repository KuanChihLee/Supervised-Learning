Implementing supervised learning techniques in Adult Income prediction
1. Data: 1994 Adult Census dataset, UCI Machine Learning Repository
2. Goal: Considering this dataset as classification problem and exploring key features contributing to higher or lower income.

In Project_data_preprocessing.ipynb
1. Dealing with missing data (drop or padding)
3. Scaling data (numerical data)
2. Feature selection/engineering (categorical data) 
3. Imbalanced observation (oversampling)

Improvement: 
1. Establishing models with the features we handled.
2. Selecting the best candidate with highest validation accuracy. 
2. Improving Sensitivity with oversampling data (note. we want predict what kind of features contributing to higher income, therefore, sensitivity is matter here!)

1. Analytical Modeling and selection (Decision Tree and Neural Network)

In Final Report_v3.pdf
1. Submission of project report

In us-census-data folder:
1. Raw data: adult_income.csv
2. After preprocessing: adult_processed.csv
3. After one-hot encoder: adult_processed_onehot.csv
4. After oversampling: adult_processed_smote.csv
